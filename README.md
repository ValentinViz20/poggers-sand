# poggers-sand
A falling sand type of game I made using pygame and Python  
Sadly back when I created this game I didn't know about GitHub, so I uploaded everything at once.

## Demo

## How to play  
- clone the repository using `git clone [URL]`
- install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run the by double-clicking the `RUN_GAME.bat` file 

## Challenges during development
The biggest challenge was how to optimize the code, so all the particles
are drawn to the screen as fast as possible. In the end I managed to get a
fine working simulation, but I'm still not satisfied with the results.
The problem is that pygame is not really optimized for this, and it would
be really hard to find some tricks to make it faster.
